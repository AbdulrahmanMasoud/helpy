## About Helpy
Helpy app is a mobile app that supports the first 3 goals of SDGs, No poverty, zero hunger, and good health.<br>
Suppose one day that you are walking in one of Cairo streets, and you see someone hungry and need food, or on a very cold night, you found someone has a bad need for clothes or blanket or maybe he needs for health care and visit hospital.<br>
Remember with me how many times you have a surplus of food and you have to throw it, and how many times you have to store your good old clothes and buy new on.<br>
